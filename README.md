## ðŸš€ Meta Workforce Strategy: Efficiency to EngagementðŸš€

## Project Overview

This **People Analytics** case study transforms Meta's post ''2023 Layoff Morale Crisis'' into a "Year of Engagement" by optimizing **top talent identification, retention, and employee morale**.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights and Recommendations

Leveraging **descriptive analysis** (N=7,500), **Pivot Tables**, and **SPSS**, I identified:

* **Top Performer Turnover Risk:** Highest turnover intentions among 'Top Performers'.
* **DEI Intervention:** Critical retention issues for 'Others' gender category, despite high satisfaction.
* **DEI Successes:** Strong engagement/retention among Black employees.

**Strategic Recommendations** to optimize **Human Capital Management**:

* **Top Talent Identification:** Implement **Management by Objectives (MBO)**.
* **Top Talent Retention:** Develop **Custom Recognition/Rewards** & targeted **DEI Management** (e.g., **BCG's BLISS Index**).
* **Employee Engagement:** Foster **compassionate leadership**, **transparent communication**, **sense of community**, and harness the power of **AI**.

## ðŸŒŸ Impact

Demonstrates my ability to **transform complex findings into strategic insights**, design **scalable people solutions** and deliver them to **non-techncial stakeholders** in order to transform year of efficiency into year of engagement.
